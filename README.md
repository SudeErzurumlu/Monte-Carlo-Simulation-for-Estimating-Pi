# Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating Pi

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the **Monte Carlo Simulation** technique to estimate the value of Pi. By generating random points within a unit square and determining how many fall inside a unit circle, the algorithm leverages the principles of probability to estimate Pi.

This simulation is a great example of how computational methods can approximate complex mathematical constants in a simple yet effective manner.

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Includes implementations in Python, MATLAB, R, C#, Julia, and more.
- **Easy-to-understand**: Clear and well-documented code that is accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.
- **Practical Use Case**: A great way to understand the principles of Monte Carlo simulations and probability estimation.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Implements efficient methods for random point generation and calculation of the proportion that lies inside the circle.

## How It Works
The algorithm estimates Pi by randomly generating a large number of points within a unit square (with coordinates ranging from 0 to 1). The number of points that fall within the unit circle (radius = 1) is counted, and the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points generated is used to estimate Pi using the formula:
The larger the number of points, the more accurate the estimation becomes.

## Languages Used
This project contains implementations in the following languages:
- **Python**
- **MATLAB**
- **R**
- **C#**
- **Julia**

Each implementation is self-contained and demonstrates the same Monte Carlo Pi estimation method in its respective language.
